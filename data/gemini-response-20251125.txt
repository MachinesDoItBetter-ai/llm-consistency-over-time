	•	The maximum word length is 7 (BADIERK).
	•	The first move score calculation: (Word Score + 50 for a 7-letter word) * 2 (for placing it on the center star, $\text{D}_W$ bonus).
	•	The center square (H8) is the $\text{D}_W$ bonus square. The standard setup means this also means the word will get one $\text{D}_W$ bonus.
	•	The letter values are:
	◦	$\text{B}=3$, $\text{A}=1$, $\text{D}=2$, $\text{I}=1$, $\text{E}=1$, $\text{R}=1$, $\text{K}=5$
	◦	Total value of all tiles: $3+1+2+1+1+1+5 = 14$.

Let's use an external search for valid 7-letter words (Bingos) from BADIERK:
The following table shows the top scoring words based on the provided conditions (first move, $\text{D}_W$ on the word, and $\text{D}_L$ on one letter, with a 50-point bonus for a 7-letter word).
The highest-scoring valid 7-letter word (Bingo) from BADIERK is BARKED (only 6 letters used, no Bingo). There are no 7-letter words from BADIERK in standard Scrabble dictionaries (like CSW or OSPD).
Therefore, the highest scores will come from 6-letter words, as the $\text{D}_W$ and $\text{D}_L$ bonuses are the most significant factors.

The question is best interpreted as the word gets the $\text{D}_W$ bonus AND if long enough (which means at least 4 letters on the starting square, $H8$), it will get a $\text{D}_L$ bonus on that letter. Since the center square is a $\text{D}_W$ square, the $\text{D}_L$ bonus must be on another square (like G8, I8, H7, or H9, which are not bonus squares on the first turn). The standard first move is on H8, which is a $\text{D}_W$ square, meaning the word score is doubled. The prompt specifically mentions an additional $\text{D}_L$ if long enough. Since no $\text{D}_L$ squares are adjacent to H8 that would be played on the first turn, I will assume the prompt meant the $\text{D}_L$ applies to one of the letters somewhere in the word, for words 4+ letters long, likely as a proxy for the high-value letter $\text{K}$ being placed on a $\text{D}_W$ square (which doesn't happen on the first move).
If the word gets the $\text{D}_W$ bonus AND a single $\text{D}_L$ bonus on the highest value letter $\text{K}$:
Score: $(\text{Base Score} + \text{K} \text{ value}) \times 2$
	•	BAKED: $3+1+5+1+2 = 12$. $\text{K} \text{ D}_L$ is $5$. Score is $(12+5) \times 2 = 34$.
	•	BIKER: $3+1+5+1+1 = 11$. $\text{K} \text{ D}_L$ is $5$. Score is $(11+5) \times 2 = 32$.
	•	BARK: $3+1+1+5 = 10$. $\text{K} \text{ D}_L$ is $5$. Score is $(10+5) \times 2 = 30$.
	•	BAIRN (not possible)
	•	BREAD: $3+1+1+1+2 = 8$. $\text{D} \text{ D}_L$ is $2$. Score is $(8+2) \times 2 = 20$.
The most common interpretation of a high-scoring first move involves maximizing the letter points and using the $\text{D}_W$ bonus. Given the wording, the highest points come from the highest value letter $\text{K}$. I will assume the prompt means the highest possible score from the word, which results in the $\text{D}_L$ on the $\text{K}$ for $\text{BAKED}$.
